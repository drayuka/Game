placement

border space definition - when growing base spaces, any space which is within 1 space of a base space placed object but also pathable without going through any base or other border spaces.

complete pathfinding -
	find paths between all empty/road spaces things within 3 border spaces a base maximum size of 20x20 (or 17x17 with protection)

	require:
		all buildings pathable from (a) spawn (except for observer)
		all spawns pathable to all room borders
		all buildings/roads within 3 of an empty pathable space (for building and repair)
		

	minimize:
		average path distance to extensions and spawns
		average path distance to labs
		nuke vulnerability (clumpiness of critical infrastructure, towers, etc) quantified by the number of towers <5 from each other
		average distance from borders (where borders are defined as any empty location not specifically in the placement) to towers
			this allows the system to not be penalized by placing buildings near areas where enemies can’t path
			distance from towers to controller
		

Order of operations:
placeAll() //places all buildings without placing them in invalid places, starts near <5 the controller
permute(base)
	//breadth first search on permuting buildings to discover local minima that don’t need repath
	if(permute space/road and building)
		hash and compare to recent to reduce repition
		verify pathing/reachability still good for nearby buildings (has reachable path))
		repath for all (c++ wasm?)
		calculate cost
		if < currentMinCost set as base
	if(permute 2 buildings)
		hash and compare to recent to reduce repition
		verify pathing/reachability (probably only matters if changing observer location as it does not need to be < 1 reachable)
		calculate cost
		if < currentMinCost set as base
		hash base
