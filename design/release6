6th release:

profiling tools (add in timing markers that are activateable by higher functions. so that they can see where their time is being used.

do not parse memory every tick, but only when we hit a global clear.

change spawning so that we first try to spawn in the local claimed room (per changes to bootstrap) and then try to go to other rooms

build out better new room logic 
	-notes:
	-new room should treat the upgrade container as storage and store all mined energy there
	-upgrading below rcl8 should involve multiple links to supply the new controller with energy as soon as available. (logistics should service energy harvesting)

mining - just sell minerals for now

testing on private server
