## A word on Obsfucation

This is a codebase for playing a specific [game](https://goo.gl/5fUP4M) which I will not mention the name of, or link directly to keep it from being webcrawled.  Suffice it to say it is considered to be bad play to give entire codebases away, but I did want to be able to leave it on github for view by people it is linked to.

# Features

For this game this codebase accomplishes a number of things, but has limited combatative routines that are mainly designed to prevent npc raiding.  This list of features includes:

* Energy harvesting
* controller upgrading
* remote mining (no source keeper rooms)
* harvest links
* energy delivery and pickup
* npc raider protection
* remote mining reservation
* building and repair of construction sites
* refill of extensions and spawns
* limit based repair of walls and ramparts
* scouting
* spawning, including spawning in remote rooms for local jobs
* minimumly viable tower control
* patching infrastructure

# Future Features

some planned future features include:

* Mineral harvest
* Automatic base placement (in progress)

# Pull requests

Despite the obsfucation, if you discover what this codebase is for (either through me linking it or otherwise) and would like to make contributions, I'm fully willing to merge them in, so please feel free.
